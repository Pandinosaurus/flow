C++14, header-\/only library for multi-\/stream data synchronization.

\doxysection*{What is this used for?}

This library is meant for generating groups of data from separate series. The core problems it is meant to address are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item How do we know which elements of data relate to one other across multiple series?
\item How do we know when this data is ready to be retrieved (\char`\"{}captured\char`\"{}) for further use?
\item How do we capture different types of data uniformly and with minimal overhead?
\end{DoxyItemize}

In addressing these problems, this library enables data-\/driven event execution using data collected from distinct streaming series.
